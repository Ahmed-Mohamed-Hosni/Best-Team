In the event that conflicts or challenges arise within the team during the Software Project course,  
what strategies should be implemented to resolve them effectively and maintain team performance?

First, the team should conduct a constructive discussion to identify the root cause of the conflict in a professional manner.  

Second, roles, responsibilities, and deadlines should be reassessed to ensure fairness, accountability, and clear expectations.  

Finally, if the conflict persists, seeking guidance from the course instructor is recommended to achieve a structured and objective resolution.
