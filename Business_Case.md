# Business Case: Global Carbon Health Alliance (GCHA)

## Section 1: Economic Summary
This section summarizes the financial viability of the GCHA project based on the analysis from problem set 2.3.

- **Net Present Value (NPV):** $679,200
- **Return on Investment (ROI):** 133.33%

## Section 2: Strategic Alignment and Lifecycle Choice
To ensure strategic alignment with different regional goals and risks, a hybrid lifecycle model will be adopted:

- **London Site (Pilot - Version 1.0): Agile**
    - *Rationale:* The pilot phase requires flexibility to adapt to user feedback from the 85 hospitals. Agile allows for iterative development and quick delivery of the core database functionality based on real user needs.

- **Berlin Site (Analytics - Version 2.0): Spiral Model**
    - *Rationale:* The AI integration involves experimental neural networks with high technical uncertainty. The Spiral model's focus on risk analysis is essential for evaluating technical feasibility and resolving risks before committing to full development.

- **Global Rollout (Version 3.0): V-Model**
    - *Rationale:* The global rollout must comply with strict regulations (GDPR, HIPAA). The V-Model's emphasis on verification and validation at each stage provides the necessary audit trail for medical compliance and regulatory approval.

## Section 3: Buy vs. Build Decision
- **Decision:** Build
- **Justification:**
    The decision to "Build" the GCHA platform rather than "Buy" an off-the-shelf solution is driven by several strategic factors:
    
    1.  **Strategic Control & IP Ownership:** Building the AI engine in-house allows GlobalCare to own the intellectual property, creating a competitive advantage in predictive medicine. A COTS solution would cede this strategic asset to a vendor.
    
    2.  **Data Privacy & Compliance:** Health data is highly sensitive and subject to varying international regulations (GDPR in Europe, HIPAA globally). Building our own solution provides complete control over data governance and security protocols, which is critical for passing medical audits.
    
    3.  **Customization & Integration:** The AI engine must integrate seamlessly with existing legacy systems across 85 hospitals in different countries. A bespoke solution ensures perfect fit and customization that pre-built software cannot offer.
    
    4.  **Economic Analysis:** While buying might have lower upfront cost ($8M vs $12M build), the build option delivers higher long-term ROI (133.33%) through ownership and eliminates ongoing licensing fees ($1.5M/year). Over 4 years, total cost of ownership favors the build strategy when considering IP value.
 
    5.  Commit message: Initial Business Case and Financial Evaluation.
